# SkyHunters

Developed a 2D plane shooter with bullet hell mechanics over 7 months during high school. The game features a roguelike-style mode, where each run is randomly generated but the difficulty remains consistent. Players try to destroy as many enemy planes as possible and can unlock new planes by paying with coins collected during gameplay or by opening loot boxes.

I was responsible for writing the code and creating the art, with additional contributions from freelancers for some art assets and music. The game was designed for mobile devices.

## Learning & Outcomes

- Planned and executed a multi-month project from concept to mid-stage, making the decision to discontinue after evaluating its viability.
- Gained experience in art creation and coordinating freelance contributions.
- Learned the importance of structuring code for maintainability and how difficult it can be to modify a system once it is built.
- Developed an understanding of the importance of user engagement and iterative design.

## Suggested Improvements

- **Platform redesign for multiplayer:** Adapt the game for console and PC to better support local (couch) multiplayer and multiplayer-friendly controls.  
- **Multiplayer modes:** Include co-op, versus, or online multiplayer modes.  
- **Additional game modes:** Introduce new gameplay modes to increase variety and replayability.
